# Appointment Management Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Logged User Details in Form
**Problem**: The appointment form was not populating with the actual logged-in user's details.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `AppointmentForm.jsx` to use `getCurrentUser()` from auth utils
- Modified login system to store user data in localStorage
- Form now automatically populates with logged-in user's name, email, and phone

### 2. ✅ Time Slot Availability
**Problem**: Time slots were not showing because the mock data had old dates (2024) but the form was selecting future dates (2025).

**Solution**:
- Updated `mockData.js` to generate dynamic available slots for the next 30 days
- Each doctor now has realistic availability patterns
- Time slots are generated based on current date + 1 to 30 days

## How to Test

### Step 1: Login
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Use any email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and any password
3. Click "Login" - this will create a mock user session

### Step 2: Test User Details Population
1. Navigate to "Find Doctors" tab
2. Click "Book Appointment" on any doctor
3. **Verify**: The form should now show:
   - **Full Name**: "John Doe" (from logged-in user)
   - **Email Address**: Your entered email
   - **Phone Number**: "+94 77 123 4567" (from logged-in user)

### Step 3: Test Time Slot Availability
1. In the appointment form, select a date (tomorrow or any future date)
2. **Verify**: The "Time Slot" dropdown should now show available times like:
   - 09:00
   - 10:30
   - 11:00
   - 14:00
   - 15:30
   - 16:00

### Step 4: Complete Booking
1. Fill in the reason for appointment
2. Click "Book Appointment"
3. **Verify**: You should see a success message with appointment ID

### Step 5: Test Admin Panel
1. Login with email: `admin@lankamed.com`
2. Go to Admin Dashboard → Appointments
3. **Verify**: You can see and manage all appointments

## Debug Information

The system now includes console logging to help debug:
- User data is logged when the appointment form opens
- Available slots are logged when a date is selected
- Check browser console (F12) for debug information

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ User Details
- Form fields should be pre-filled with logged-in user's information
- No need to manually enter name, email, or phone

### ✅ Time Slots
- Selecting any future date should show available time slots
- Time slots should be realistic (9 AM to 4 PM range)
- Some slots may be unavailable (realistic simulation)

### ✅ Booking Flow
- Complete booking should work smoothly
- Success message should appear
- Appointment should appear in "My Appointments" tab

## Troubleshooting

If time slots still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Ensure you're selecting a future date (not today or past)
3. Try refreshing the page and logging in again

If user details don't populate:
1. Check if you're logged in (should see user info in top navigation)
2. Try logging out and logging back in
3. Check browser console for any errors

## Technical Details

- **User Data**: Stored in localStorage under 'user' key
- **Available Slots**: Generated dynamically for next 30 days
- **Mock Data**: Uses realistic patterns for doctor availability
- **Debug Logs**: Available in browser console for troubleshooting
